# 2D_game_engine

Description: This is my first 2D-game engine. It uses the SDL library to run.

A basic game engine that allows the player to jump, run, and slide. It has basic collitions implemented, but there are some issues with collitions on corners of platforms that still need to be fixed.

Controls:

	Jump:  Space

	Run:   Left - a
	       Right - d

	Slide: Left Shift
